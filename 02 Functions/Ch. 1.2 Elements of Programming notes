3. The Non-Pure Print Function
    3.1 Pure functions
        Pure functions have the property that applying them has no effects beyond returning a value. 
        >>>abs(-2ï¼‰ 
    3.2 Non-pure functions
        In addition to returning a value, applying a non-pure function can generate side effects, which make some change to the state of the interpreter or computer.
        >>>print(-2)
        The value that print returns is always None.
